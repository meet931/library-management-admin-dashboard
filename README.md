# Library Management System - Admin Dashboard

The **Library Management System - Admin Dashboard** is a modern, efficient solution for managing users, roles, and permissions in a library setting. Built using **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, and **MUI (Material-UI)**, this dashboard ensures streamlined access control and adaptability to organizational needs.

---

## **Key Definitions**

1. **User**: A person with an account in the library management system (e.g., Alice, Bob).
2. **Role**: A job title or designation that groups certain permissions (e.g., Manager, Librarian, Assistant).
3. **Permission**: A specific action that a user is allowed to perform (e.g., Add Book, Edit Book, View Records).

---

## **System Features**

### **1. Role Management**

Roles define what a user can do by bundling permissions together. Each user is assigned a role.

#### Example Roles:
- **Manager**: Full system control (e.g., Add/Edit/Delete Books, Add/Remove Users, View Records).
- **Librarian**: Manages books and records but cannot manage users (e.g., Add/Edit Books, View Records).
- **Library Assistant**: Limited to viewing books and member records.
- **Research Assistant** (Custom Role): Temporary role with restricted access (e.g., View Books Only).

---

### **2. Permission Management**

Permissions are the building blocks of roles, representing individual tasks users can perform.

#### Example Permissions:
- **Books**: Add, Edit, Delete, View.
- **Users**: Add, Edit, Delete, Change Status.
- **Records**: View Member Records.

#### How Permissions Relate to Roles:
- A **Manager** role might include all permissions.
- A **Librarian** role might only include book and record management permissions.

---

### **3. User Management**

Admins can add, update, and deactivate users, as well as assign or change roles to control user access.

#### Example Scenarios:
- **Adding a User**: Assign a role to give the user specific permissions.
- **Promoting a Librarian**: Change a user's role from Librarian to Manager, granting additional permissions.
- **Deactivating a User**: Temporarily disable a userâ€™s access by marking them inactive.

---

## **Practical Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Adding a New Employee**
1. Admin creates a new user account for **David**.
2. Assigns the **Library Assistant** role, which includes permissions like "View Books."

### **Scenario 2: Promoting a Librarian**
1. Admin updates **Bob's** role from **Librarian** to **Manager**.
2. Bob gains additional permissions to manage users and records.

### **Scenario 3: Restricting Access**
1. **Charlie** takes leave. The admin marks his account as **Inactive**.
2. Charlie's account is disabled, restricting access.

### **Scenario 4: Updating a Role**
1. Admin adds "Delete Books" permission to the **Librarian** role.
2. All users with the Librarian role gain this new ability.
